 			<p>Having been training in Gastroenterology within the NHS for over 15 years, I have been a consultant for over 5 years and currently work as a consultant gastroenterologist at Barking Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust. There, I regularly see a variety of patients with all sorts of problems to do with their gastrointestinal systems – such as abdominal pain, altered bowel movements and difficulty swallowing – and their liver (or hepatic) system – such as jaundice, pale coloured stools and enlarged livers. I also look after patients who have emergency bleeding into their guts. I also perform a variety of treatments using endoscopy (a telescope with instruments that is either inserted through the mouth into the upper part of the gut or through the anus into the lower part of the gut). My training involved a specialist training programme in gastroenterology and hepatology, in which I learnt and was assessed as being competent in terms of my knowledge and practical skills in a variety of areas related to gastroenterology. Furthermore, I have been formally assessed by the JAG (Joint Advisory Group of GI Endoscope) and deemed competent for independent endoscopes in upper GI, Flexible Sigmoidoscopy and Colonoscopic procedures. That means that, if you need it, I can help diagnose and treat your problems by performing a gastroscopy, colonoscopy, complex polypectomy, advanced therapeutic procedures like endoscopic fistula closures, stenting and ERCPs. I also perform endoscopic ultrasound examinations having completed my advanced training in endoscopic ultrasonography in the prestigious unit at Montreal University Hospital under the tutelage of Professor Anand Sahai. Having attended more than 20 national and international conferences and presented over 10 times, with 5 publications in high impact journals, I always seek to stay at the cutting edge of gastroenterology, so that I can give my patients the best, evidenced-based treatment options to help them to recover. I have also taught Cambridge University and Oxford University medical students as well as being a course examiner for the Royal College of Physicians.</p>
